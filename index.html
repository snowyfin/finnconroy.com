        Hello! I'm Finn Conroy. Im currently a high school student, here I store projects that I have done throughout highschool. As of Jan 29, 2024 the two classes that are included on this site are Materials & Processing 1, and Engineering & Design.
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Some things you should know</h3>
        <br>I'm someone who is an overachiever. When I get given a project, I try to make it as fun and interactive as I can for myself.</li>
        <br><br>I've been coding in HTML for around a year, and have a good understanding of web development and design.</li>
        <br><br>I am someone who cares a lot about what they do, and will put a lot of passion into my projects, so that they truely reflect my skill.</li>
        
        This site was coded entirely by hand, and is being hosted on github.
        I like to code, and learn a lot about many subjects. I think that when I get into college I am going to go for an Engineering degree.
