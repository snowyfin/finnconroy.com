        <h2>Machine League Baseball</h2>
        <p>Starting out with this project, I thought that my group was going to do well. Further into the project I figured out that my solution wasn't going to work the best that we could with the materials provided.</p>
        <p>I liked the idea of this project, but the way I executed it made it so that it wasn't all that good.</p>
        <p>This project taught me that my solution isn't going to work out, and it sometimes needs more thoughts before you exhaust all of your resources.</p>
